For C24A, we did the extra credit.

The display updates so that it's apparent to the user when two or more players are in the same room 
(e.g., when a suggestion is made and the player's token gets moved to the room).

To test this please play the game. You'll see that when two or more players are in the same room, they are on different cells.
